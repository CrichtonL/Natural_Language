The measure of "coorectly translated word in correct position" is not a good
measure of the quality of the performance. Because my translator will translate the 
French sentense into an English sentense with exactly the same length (without null word). 
Most of French sentenses has a different length from its correct English translation.

Instead of using "correctly translated word in correct position"
My evaluation method allow the "correctly translated word" appear within a resonable range from
the position it should be in the correct translation. e.g. In the correct translation "wow" is the ith
word of the correct translation. If "wow" is the jth word in my translation and abs(j-i) is less than a 
certain number, "wow" will be considered to be translated correctly. 

The performance does not improve too much by increasing the number of sentenses for training AM. 
Word order is a crucial weakness of my translater. in many cases my translation has a very different
word order from the correct answer. Due to the limited size of the traning data, some French words in the testing
sentense never appear in the traning data and get translated in to "UNK".  By further increasing the corpus size,
improving ordering algorithm or switch N-gram model (N > 2) , a better performance will be achieved.
